#### **About Myself:**

I'm switcher from medical field, for 7 years I was studying dentistry in medical university, worked as general dentist for 3+ years, and after 24th february 2022, I came to realization, that life is too short, and can over any moment, so i decided to start doing what I have passion about.<br>

My purpose is to create modern web projects, make, or take part in something useful, something what can help people and make their life easier or more fulfulled. <br>

My past work experience hardly can be related to front-end development in terms of hard skills, but as doctor I have such soft skills as empathy, ability to listen and hear people, properly communicate with them. Ability to hard work, give all what I got to my work, never stop in growing and developing my professional skills, this is what, I think, makes me a descent employee. <br>

#### **Code Examples:**

**"Count characters in your string" kata:**  The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. <br>

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.<br>

**Solution:**

```
function count (string) {  
    
    if (string.length <= 0) return {};

    let outputObj = {};

    string.split('').forEach( item => {

    Object.hasOwn(outputObj, item) ?  outputObj = {...outputObj, [item]: outputObj[item] + 1} : outputObj = {...outputObj, [item] : 1};

    })

    return outputObj
}
```
